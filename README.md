# Alfred Bot

## Solution branch

- [ ] Create a project folder in your Java stack folder called "alfredBot"
- [ ] Create an [`AlfredQuotes.java`](src/AlfredQuotes.java) class file that will hold all of Alfredbot's functionality.
- [ ] Create an [`AlfredTest.java`](src/AlfredTest.java) main program file that will execute code to test our `AlfredQuotes` class.
- [ ] Implement the `guestGreeting` method, and test it by first compiling the test file with the javac command and then running the test file with the java command in your terminal.
- [ ] Implement the `dateAnnouncement` method, and test it.
- [ ] Implement the `answeringBeforeAlexis` method, and test it.
- [ ] NINJA BONUS: Implement your own method for the Alfred bot using any of the built-in String methods you've learned. Maybe he can yell..
